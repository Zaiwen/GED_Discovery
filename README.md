## Discovering Graph Entity Dependencies 
Graph entity dependencies (GEDs) are novel graph constraints, unifying keys and functional dependencies, for property graphs. In this work, we study the discovery problem of GEDs â€“ finding a minimal cover of valid GEDs in a given graph data. We formalise the problem, and propose an effective and efficient approach to overcome major bottlenecks in GED discovery.

## System Requirements
- Java 1.8
- Python 3

## Python Dependencies
- pandas
- glob
- itertools
- Levenshtein
- multiprocessing

## Execution Steps
We divide the GDD mining process into the following three steps: 
1. **Frequent Subgraph Mining**:
   - input data in folder: `resource/`
   - output data in the folder: `test/process_1_producer/queryGraph`
   - run command: `java -jar GraMi_ExactSubgraphMatching-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar filename=graph.lg datasetFolder=resource/ freq=20`
   - parameters: `filename` refers to the target graph data file, `datasetFolder` indicates the folder where the graph data is located, `freq` set frequency threshold.
2. **Homomorphic Subgraph Matching**:
   - input data in folder: `test/process_1_producer/purePattern2`
   - output data in the folder: `test/process_2_producer/pre_Table`
   - run command: `java -jar graphflow-0.1.0.jar`
3. **Dependency Mining**:
   - input data in folder: `test/process_2_producer/pre_Table`
   - output data in the folder: `result/`
   - run command: `java -jar GEDdependencyMining-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /path/to/python /path/to/dependency_mining.py /path/to/ -1 -1`
   - parameters: `/path/to/python` represents the current Python compiler path, `/path/to/dependency_mining.py` indicates the path to the dependency mining Python file, `/path/to` indicates the folder path where the current jar package is located, the first `-1` represents the limit on the number of attributes in the mining data table\[-1 represents unlimited\], the second `-1` represents the limit on the number of rows in the mining data table\[-1 represents unlimited\].

## Running Example
We provide an toy example dataset in the folder `resource/`, you can complete the above three steps by executing the following command: 
```
```
The following message appears to indicate that the entire process has been completed. 
```
```
You can change all the parameters in `TBC`, and the mined GDD is recorded in the folder `result/`
